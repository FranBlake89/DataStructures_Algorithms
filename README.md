### Reflection - Francisco Castillo

Throughout this assignment, I delved into various aspects of algorithmic problem-solving, expanding my understanding and skill set. Key takeaways include hands-on experience in implementing hash tables using linear probing and navigating maze traversal using recursion. Collaborating with peers highlighted the importance of teamwork, showcasing the power of collaboration.

Challenges were overcome through collaborative problem-solving, emphasizing the effectiveness of sharing insights for innovative solutions. This assignment contributed to my growth as a problem solver and a team player.

### Credits

This project was developed by Team 3 (Marife DelaTorre, Snehal, Francisco Castillo) for the Data Structures and Algorithms course at Seneca Polytechnic.
