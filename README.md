## Reflection - Francisco Castillo
Throughout this assignment, I had the opportunity to dive into various aspects of algorithmic problem-solving, which greatly expanded my understanding and skill set.

One of the key takeaways was gaining hands-on experience in implementing hash tables using linear probing. I delved into the mechanics of hash functions, collision handling, and the concept of tombstones for marking deleted elements. This provided me with valuable insights into data structure design and efficient storage mechanisms.

Navigating through maze traversal using recursion was another significant learning experience. While working on the "find_path" function, I not only grasped the intricacies of recursive logic but also honed my visualization skills. Breaking down complex problems into simpler visual representations enabled me to better comprehend algorithmic solutions.

Collaborating closely with my peers, particularly during maze generation, emphasized the importance of teamwork in solving intricate challenges. This assignment highlighted that combining diverse perspectives and strengths can lead to innovative solutions and a deeper understanding of the problem domain.

However, I realized that there's room to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and their real-world applications. While I gained insights into various algorithms, I recognize the need to further explore how these algorithms are employed in practical scenarios.

Challenges were a part of this journey, with maze generation being particularly intricate. The process demanded the integration of multiple concepts, which required collaborative problem-solving and rigorous discussions. Overcoming this challenge showcased the power of collaboration and the effectiveness of sharing insights to arrive at effective solutions.

In retrospect, this assignment was a valuable learning experience that encompassed diverse areas of algorithms and data structures. From hash tables to maze traversal, the knowledge gained and challenges conquered have undoubtedly contributed to my growth as a problem solver and a team player.
