# Part D: Reflections


## Reflection for Marife Dela Torre

1. Please detail what exactly **you** did for the assignment.
   I was the main author for Part A of this assignment and I also contributed with Fran on understanding how the implementation of Parts B and C and how all parts were connected with each other. I created our repository for the group and I ended up giving out the remaining parts to do with my other team members, which in this case was parts B and C. 
2. What was one thing **you** learned when doing this assignment?
  I learned one practical application, which is creating mazes, for the Minimum Spanning Tree. I could not imagine at first how I could apply this concept before this assignment. But doing this assignment made me realize that these theoretical concepts could be useful in solving real world problems just like this case. 
3. What was its most challenging aspect and what did **you** do to overcome this challenge?
   The most challenging would be understanding how we would apply the Prim's Algorithm (MST) to create the maze. The collaborative efforts that me and one of my team members, Francisco, made it easier to understand the steps that we have to implement to generate the maze. Visualizing the data structure also helped us to understand what we want to achieve. Moreover, understanding the implementation of the Prim's Algorithm (Part B) was one of the solutions to overcome this challenge. Connecting all parts is the most important task that we did to accomplish this assignment. 

## Reflection for SNEHAL
1. Please detail what exactly **you** did for the assignment.

Due of my personal issues, I made contributions to the task later. Part C had already been completed by my teammates, but I accomplished it on my own. In that section, I made a labyrinth design using a graph structure. The method creates walls between cells based on rows and columns, assigns random weights to edges, and computes a minimum spanning tree in order to maintain connectivity. The resulting maze is represented as a list of walls.

My code is in all the comments in a3_partc.py.

2. What was one thing **you** learned when doing this assignment?

My buddies were the ones who pushed me to participate and get grades; I didn't contribute at first, but after being given the opportunity, I completed Part C all by myself without taking help of anybody. They are therefore one of the main reasons I completed this task. I learned the importance of team work and collaboration as this makes the job easier.
I sincerely appreciate Marife and Fran helping me out. 

3. What was its most challenging aspect and what did **you** do to overcome this challenge?

Coordinating the production of walls, edges, and the least spanning tree method to produce a cohesive and accessible maze layout while taking the grid structure into consideration is the most difficult component.
By carefully specifying the requirements for wall placement, creating bidirectional edges, and employing the minimal spanning tree approach, the problem was resolved. I used nested loops to choose which walls to create while taking into account each cell's bottom and right neighbours. The addition of both edges between linked cells addressed the bidirectional nature of walls. I incorporated the given function to determine which walls to maintain and delete while preserving maze connection in order to apply the minimal spanning tree technique. This collaboration made sure that the labyrinth pattern was practical.


## Reflection for Francisco Castillo


1. Please detail what exactly **you** did for the assignment.
   
  For the assignment, I played a major role in both Part B and Part C. In Part B, I assumed primary authoring responsibility. I was instrumental in implementing the minimum spanning tree algorithm using Kruskal's method.
In Part C, I collaborated closely with my colleague Marife. Together we tackled the difficult task of generating mazes. This segment required us to combine concepts from several previous tasks, applying what we had learned in class. In addition, I helped refine the implementation by ensuring that each edge was assigned a random weight, thus improving the randomness of the maze generation.

2. What was one thing **you** learned when doing this assignment?
   
  The most valuable lesson I gained from completing this assignment was the hands-on experience of applying the minimum spanning tree algorithm. By working on Part B, I was able to understand the intricacies of Kruskal's method and its application in solving real-world problems. In addition, this assignment provided me with the opportunity to bridge the gap between the theoretical knowledge acquired in class and its practical application in algorithmic problem solving. Consequently, my understanding of the fundamental concepts improved tremendously, enriching my overall learning. But would be great for future courses to have a real-life application because I don't feel confident about how to apply this in the "real world".

3. What was its most challenging aspect and what did **you** do to overcome this challenge?
   
   Part C proved to be the most complex section of the assignment. The integration of several concepts and the need to understand how they interacted to arrive at a final solution posed a formidable challenge. To overcome this obstacle, I worked closely with Marife. We combined our strengths and leveraged our collective knowledge to design an effective strategy. Through in-depth analysis and problem-solving discussions, we identified an approach to maze generation that met the requirements of the assignment. This collaborative effort was instrumental in overcoming the complexity of Part C and ensuring the successful completion of the assignment.
