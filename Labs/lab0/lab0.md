## LaTex Formulas

- $$c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$$

- $$\sum_{i=\emptyset}^{n}ar^i$$

- $$\sum_{i=1}^{n}i=1+2+3+4+...n =\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$

## Reflection here


Learning how to write an md file is very important for our career because it allows us to communicate how to install dependencies, describe our project, stages of the project, record changes, etc. It is essential to communicate and collaborate with others, and the "natural way" of displaying graphics and mathematical formulas is indispensable to achieve this. 

Now, answering the questions the professor have given us:

1. What aspect of the lab did you find to be the hardest?

It was deal with LaTex and how to implement correctly on GitHub, but the documentation was very helpful.

2. What do you think about CodeSpaces? What did you like/not like about Codespaces?

It is another tool that facilitate the life and portability of the coders, now we can write code from any device. I prefer my preference because I have not used it enough, but for now I will continue using VsCode and GitHub desktop on local.
