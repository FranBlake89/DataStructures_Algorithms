# Reflection for Lab 1 by Francisco Castillo

Definitively Python is different from C/C++, for it was easiest to understand the problems with my functions or just read the code. It was more versatile when I try to implement my logic, something that doesn't like it was the indentation (I had some errors because the indentation didn't match) but nothing that an extension couldn't fix, now I am using prettier to avoid this issues. The classes works super different from C/C++, python simplify the process did the code more readable.
The similarities between python and C/C++ are the use similar loops, conditionals and functions. The structures in conditional is the same with different syntax.
The difference are more rather similarities, as memory management, python doesn't have do-while loops, python is an interpreted language while c/c++ are compiled language.
In conclusion,C/C++ has more control over hardware resources and offers better performance for computationally intensive applications. This language is complex and error-prone, but offers fine-grained control over resources. On the other hand, Python's automatic memory management simplifies development and reduces the risk of memory-related errors by managing memory allocation and deallocation.
